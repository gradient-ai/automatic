"""
Detect model type

Works for v1 and v2-base (EPS models), both standard inference and inpainting

But looking at model dumps between EPS and V type models, its only about parametrization, there are no differences in actual model (its just weighted differently without any structural difference)
So i don't see easy way to auto-detect if model should be run in `EPS` or `V` mode
Only difference are some calculations in `ldm/models/diffusion/ddpm.py` and by then we already need to know which code-path to trigger
(maaaybe there could be a way by looking at some cherry-picked base tensors min/max range, but I dont see that as reliable)
